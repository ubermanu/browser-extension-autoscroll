**Roller** is an extension that allow auto scrolling of web pages, by pressing the **mouse wheel button**, on **Linux**.

## Install

You can download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roller/kdcakfeidhfeilahlclgbnmpgebafjpm) or the [Firefox Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/af/firefox/addon/roller-scroll/).

> The extension is not available on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store, because Windows already supports auto scrolling.
