# TODO

From the original repo:

- [ ] Use the nice Radiance and Ambiance images provided by a user
- [ ] Add better scaling (slower when near the disc, faster when away from the disc, like in Firefox)
- [ ] Add configurable scaling
- [ ] Move speed should be 0 = slowest, 10 = fastest
- [ ] Use a slider for the move speed, rather than a number box
- [ ] Fix the severe bug with pinch-to-zoom on Mac
- [ ] Add better promotional images on the Chrome Web Store
- [ ] Add in an option for reversing the X and Y axis (up is down, down is up, etc.)
- [ ] Add in touchscreen/tablet support
- [ ] When scrolling horizontally, it should only scroll when the mouse is to the left/right of the disc, like in Firefox
- [ ] When scrolling vertically, it should only scroll when the mouse is to the top/bottom of the disc, like in Firefox
- [ ] Add in an option to stop autoscrolling when the user scrolls with the mouse wheel
- [ ] Option for keyboard-only control
- [ ] Option to change the key binding for activating AutoScroll
- [ ] Switch to the new options page system (in Chrome)
